#### Role: Scribe
#### Tools: Figma

## Problem Statement

> We are developing an app that helps plan to commute in the most eco-friendly route to their destination for those who want to practice being environmentally friendly by using transportation/real-time data, tracking their carbon footprint, and providing the total carbon emissions the user has saved from their trips on the app so that, they can contribute to preserving the planet!

## Our goals for Eco-Zot

* Reduce carbon emissions and harmful toxins/pollution
* Give users a digestible way of seeing modes of transportation
* Gamify reducing carbon emissions
* Reward sustainable behavior
* Make the world a better and cleaner place to live

## Comparative Analysis:

#### McDonald’s

Strengths: Reward points system that motivates user to keep using app
Weaknesses: Rewards are specialized for their own company.

#### ZOTFinder

Strengths: Accurate system of providing a walking path to a certain location
Weaknesses: Specifically made for UCI campus, fails to show any concern for environmental impacts.

#### Google Maps

Strength: Shows user their location and route to their destination as well as additional information like how many miles away it is and how long it will take to get there with different transportation methods
Weaknesses: Doesn’t show the carbon emissions from each transportation method

## Design Process

In the beginning, I had a lot of difficulties presenting ideas as a group. While designing, we had conflicts about color harmony and implementing some other features, but we were able to compromise and come up with a good design together.
I wasn't familiar with the design tool Figma, so I tried to contribute to the team by creating storyboards and user interfaces for the features I was responsible for, adapting to other people's designs and getting feedback. I created a setup page, and a simple storyboard, and envisioned how people would use Eco-Zot. After a lot of trial and error, I was able to complete the final product design!
