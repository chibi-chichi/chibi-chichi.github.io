# Eco-Zot
#### Role: Scribe
#### Team: Var-temp
#### Tools: Figma

## Problem Statement

> We are developing an app that helps plan to commute in the most eco-friendly route to their destination for those who want to practice being environmentally friendly by using transportation/real-time data, tracking their carbon footprint, and providing the total carbon emissions the user has saved from their trips on the app so that, they can contribute to preserving the planet!

## Our goals for Eco-Zot

* Reduce carbon emissions and harmful toxins/pollution
* Give users a digestible way of seeing modes of transportation
* Gamify reducing carbon emissions
* Reward sustainable behavior
* Make the world a better and cleaner place to live

## Comparative Analysis:

#### McDonald’s

Strengths: Reward points system that motivates user to keep using app
Weaknesses: Rewards are specialized for their own company.

#### ZOTFinder

Strengths: Accurate system of providing a walking path to a certain location
Weaknesses: Specifically made for UCI campus, fails to show any concern for environmental impacts.

#### Google Maps

Strength: Shows user their location and route to their destination as well as additional information like how many miles away it is and how long it will take to get there with different transportation methods
Weaknesses: Doesn’t show the carbon emissions from each transportation method

## Design Process

The group collectively spent a period of time searching through the internet to look for inspiration on what the app should look like. There were disagreements along the way, but we eventually settled on the app's color, font, and overall goal.
I ran into issues where some features were difficult to implement or lacked color coordination. Teammates were also unfamiliar with Figma but we collaborated as a team to figure out the solutions for our design idea. We settled on a mix of light and dark green, beige white, and a pink accent to highlight important features to the user such as buttons or viewing data.
We got together in real-time and started designing our prototypes while taking 30-minute breaks where we peer-reviewed and gave feedback on each other’s designs. I worked on the “Start Journey” page and the logo of the app. As a moderator, I also supervised my teammates with their designs whenever they needed help applying their design ideas to Figma. Later on after trial and error and integrating input into our new prototypes, we ultimately finished the final product design of Eco-Zot!
